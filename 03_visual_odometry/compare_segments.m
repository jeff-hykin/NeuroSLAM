    % input parameters
    % seg1, seg2 represent 1D arrays of the intensity profiles of the current image and previous image.
    % shift_length is the range of offsets in pixels to consider i.e. slen = 0 considers only the no offset case
    % compare_length_of_intensity is the length of the intensity profile to actually compare, and must be < than image width ï¿½ 1 * slen

    % output parameters
